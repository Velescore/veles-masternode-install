## Supported Linux Distributions
Veles Masternode Installer script can be safely run on any platform, and will work most of modern Linux distributions with **systemd** support. We plan to support sysVinit and OpenRC in a future. 

If your system is not supported, running this script has **no** side effects - thanks to extensive dependency checking, it will simply exit with an error message containing hints onto which commands/packages are missing on your system and how to install them.

*Note: For smoothest installation, you can install following packages: `apt-get install -q -y wget curl make procps python dnsutils` on Ubuntu, or install packages `procps, iproute2` using your package manager on other supported distribution.
